# ANNDL Challenges - Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning 2023-2024 ü§ñüåü

Welcome to the ANNDL Challenges repository! This project is dedicated to exploring various challenges in the field of Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning. Here, you'll find two main challenges that focus on different aspects of machine learning.

## Challenges Overview

### Challenge 1 - Image Classification üì∏
In this challenge, we tackle the task of image classification using deep learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify images into predefined categories. This challenge involves data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

- **Key Technologies**: TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Notable Techniques**: Data Augmentation, Transfer Learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

For more details, check out the [Image Classification Notebook](Challenge 1 -  Image Classification/ImageClassification.ipynb).
